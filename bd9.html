<p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)

<br>
AIDS - acquired immunodeficiency syndrome - was first reported in the United States in 1981 and has since become a major worldwide epidemic. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)<br></p>


<p>A degenerative and fatal nervous system disorder. Affected individuals can remain asymptomatic for decades after infection and then progress rapidly to dementia, severe loss of coordination and death. We are told by the Blood establishment that the risk of CJD being transmitted through Blood products is 'theoretical.' The infectious agent has (yes, has) been found in Blood products.<br>


Today CJD is, in our opinion, under-researched, under-investigated and extremely under-reported.
 CJD cases around the world by geographical area show that CJD is more common than generally thought.
 This disease is feared and avoided by many medical professionals when diagnosed in
 its advanced stages. It resembles in many ways the infamous Mad Cow Disease or Bovine Spongiform
 Encephalopathy (BSE). There is also concern about Chronic Wasting Disease (New Mad Cow Disease).
 As in Mad Cow Disease, scientists believe abnormal brain proteins that have undergone a peculiar
 shape change can cause other brain proteins to do the same causing CJD. Variants are nCJD, vCJD
 and nvCJD.</P>

<p>Transmission of CJD has been proven from human to human by the transplantation of dura mater, 
the injection of pituitary-derived human growth hormone, and more rarely by the reuse of EEG
 electrodes and corneal transplantation. Currently, there is no test for the disease, however,
 all Blood banking organizations in Europe and US, prohibit Blood donation by individuals who have
 symptoms or a family history of symptoms. Blood donors are carefully questioned about family
 history of CJD and surgeries that involved transplanted dura mater.</p>
<p> If they answer affirmatively to any of these questions, they are permanently deferred as a donor.
 There is no possibility of contracting CJD by making a normal Blood donation.</P>

Malaria

<br>
Approximately 300 million people worldwide are affected by malaria and between 1 and 1.5 million people die from it every year. Previously extremely widespread, the malaria is now mainly confined to Africa, Asia and Latin America. The problems of controlling malaria in these countries are aggravated by inadequate health structures and poor socioeconomic conditions.
The situation has become even more complex over the last few years with the increase in resistance to the drugs normally used to combat the parasite that causes the disease. 

ate, vigorous and wide-scale response to epidemics
The development of reliable information on infection risk, living conditions of concerned populations, and vectors
Malaria is complex but it is a curable and preventable disease.
 Lives can be saved if the disease is detected early and adequately treated.
 It is known what action is necessary to prevent the disease and to avoid or
 contain epidemics and other critical situations. 
The technology to prevent, monitor, diagnose and treat malaria exists.
 It needs to be adapted to local conditions and to be applied through local and
 national malaria control programmes.</h2></p>
